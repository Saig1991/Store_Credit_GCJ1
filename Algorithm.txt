Create main program that reads in input from file, constructs a store object with the number and list of items and a customer object with the credit.

The program assumes that each test case has atleast one solution as the specification states.

Main.cpp:
main function (reads in file, loops over number of test cases, for each test case instance it constructs a store and a customer and calls the stores find objects function).

Store.cpp/Store.h:
//Use a queue because we want to be able to remove the front item whilst
// searching for the two items that satisfy the constraint.
Store(int numItems)
//Searches the store with the constraint from the customer to find the two objects.
std::queue<int> findObjects(Customer &cust)
// Remove item from Store.
removeFrontItem();
// Add item to store
addItem();

Customer.cpp/Customer.h:
//Initialise customer with the amount of money they have.
Customer(int credit)
// Return the amount that the customer has.
int showCredit();
